# Nostr Microblog Post - SCT Announcement

## Version 1: Full (280 chars)

The technology arrived. The platforms captured it.

Building Sovereign Composable Tools - the anti-algorithm stack for intentional information sovereignty.

✅ Plurcast - Post to Nostr/Mastodon from CLI
✅ rss-wasm - Token-efficient feeds for humans & agents
🧪 sct-npow - PoW-filtered Nostr reader

Your attention. Your audience. Your data.

## Version 2: Punchy (shorter, ~200 chars)

The platforms stole your attention and audience.

Time to take them back.

Introducing Sovereign Composable Tools:
→ Own your data & keys
→ Intentional consumption, not algorithms
→ Compose with Unix tools
→ Built for humans AND agents

## Version 3: Technical Focus (~250 chars)

In 1997, "The Sovereign Individual" predicted cryptography would enable individual sovereignty.

The tech arrived. Platforms captured it.

SCT reclaims it:
• Pure WASM + Unix philosophy
• Nostr/Mastodon/SSB native
• Local-first SQLite
• Same tools for humans & AI agents

## Version 4: Problem/Solution (~220 chars)

Every platform wants to:
❌ Control what you see
❌ Control who sees you
❌ Monetize your attention

Sovereign Composable Tools:
✅ Intentional feeds (RSS/Nostr PoW)
✅ Multi-platform posting (Plurcast)
✅ Local-first, composable, owned by YOU

## Version 5: Agent-Focused (~240 chars)

Building agentic workflows?

Stop scraping HTML. Stop paying for APIs that can be revoked.

SCT tools are designed for both humans AND agents:
• RSS: 2K tokens vs 50K for HTML
• Pure WASM, runs anywhere
• Stdin/stdout composable
• Local-first

## Thread Version (3-part series)

### Part 1:
The platforms stole your attention and audience.

In 1997, "The Sovereign Individual" predicted cryptography would enable individuals to escape institutional control.

The technology arrived exactly as predicted: Nostr, Bitcoin, cryptographic identities.

But platforms captured it.

### Part 2:
Introducing Sovereign Composable Tools - the anti-algorithm stack.

✅ Plurcast: Post to Nostr/Mastodon/SSB from CLI
✅ rss-wasm: Intentional feeds, token-efficient for agents
🧪 sct-npow: Read Nostr by PoW, not algorithms
🔮 sct-vec: Local vector search (Q1 2026)

Unix philosophy meets decentralized protocols.

### Part 3:
These tools serve both humans seeking agency AND agents needing composable primitives.

• Own your data, keys, execution
• Local-first SQLite
• Pure WASM portability
• Compose via stdin/stdout

Your attention. Your audience. Your data.

## Quick Tips for Posting:

1. **Best time**: When US + Europe overlap (9am-12pm ET)
2. **Hashtags**: #grownostr is most active, #sovereignty #rust #wasm for technical audience
3. **Engagement**: Reply to comments about The Sovereign Individual - book is popular on Nostr
4. **Format**: Nostr clients handle line breaks differently - test formatting in your client first
5. **Follow-up**: Post code examples after initial announcement
6. **Value**: Set up zaps if you haven't - v4v culture is strong on Nostr

## Suggested Follow-up Posts:

**Day 2 - Code Example:**
```
How to break free from platform algorithms in one line:

curl https://blog.com/feed.xml | rss-wasm parse | jq '.items[].title'

No tracking. No ads. No algorithm deciding what you see.

Just intentional consumption.

That's Sovereign Composable Tools.
```

**Day 3 - Agent Focus:**
```
Your AI agent monitoring OpenAI announcements:

HTML scraping: 50K+ tokens 💸
RSS parsing: ~2K tokens ✅

That's 25x cost reduction.

This is why rss-wasm is built for both humans and agents.

Same tools. Same sovereignty.
```

**Day 4 - Philosophical:**
```
"The Sovereign Individual" predicted the information age would enable individual sovereignty through cryptography.

1997: Prediction
2009: Bitcoin arrives
2016: Nostr created
2024: Platforms still own your attention

2025: Time to build the tools the book predicted.
```
